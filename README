Smashing App README
===================

Smashing App (http://smashingapp.com) is a website dedicated to experimenting
with IBM WebSphere sMash, a web application runtime focused on an agile
development environment that leverages Groovy and PHP scripting languages by
default and is optimized to quickly create RESTful Web services.

There are a lot of awesome concepts encapsulated in sMash. Smashing App
is an annotation of the WebSphere sMash technology through a collection of
thoughts, cookbook-style recipes, code snippets, and more.

WebSphere sMash itself is developed in the open at http://projectzero.org.
There are community features such as blogging, forum discussions, bug tracking,
and source.

Content at http://smashingapp.com is generated periodically from this source. If you
would like to contribute appropriate content, fork, edit, commit, and then send
me a pull request.
